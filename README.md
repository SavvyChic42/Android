In my previous article I wrote detailed steps on How to create a simple android application. In that particular app I also explained concepts of android button and basic concepts of android.
You can find all my other articles in Android section.
In this article we will create a calculator android app. This is a simple calculator with limited functionality.

Letâ€™s get started with our calculator android App:
Step-1
Open your Android Studio
Click on Start a New Android Studio Project.
Give your Application Name CrunchifyCalculator  and leave other fields blank as it is, then click NEXT.

Step-2
Select the Minimum SDK API 15: Android 4.0.3(IceCreamSandwich). I selected API 15 (IceCreamSandwich) because it covers almost 94% device and it 
has almost all the features. If you want to cover 100% device then you can select API 8: Android 2.2(Froyo).

Step-3
Select the Empty Activity and click NEXT.
Leave the activity name MainActivity as it is and leave everything as it is. Click Finish.

Step-4
After clicking Finish, it takes around around ~2 minutes to build Activity and files.
Here is a final project structure for your application.

Step-5
Now we have to add our Java code in our MainActivity.java file.
So open you MainActivity.java file from left side of IDE (app  -> java -> com.crunchify.tutorials.crunchifycalculator -> MainActivity.java)
